# Abstract

How should you choose the judges, jurors, or reviewers who form a panel — and does
that upstream choice change how well you can evaluate them *without an answer key*?
A panel can be selected many ways — by competence, by a representative lottery
(**sortition**), by ideological bloc, or at random — and, separately, its noisy
judgments can be evaluated blind: given the agreement/disagreement pattern among
three binary judges, the `ntqr` package's error-independent (EIE) evaluator returns
logically consistent estimates of item prevalence and per-judge accuracy with no
labels at all. But that evaluator takes the panel as given. We join the two
questions and ask whether the *rule that forms the panel* changes the
oracle-referenced error of the no-answer-key evaluation — how far the blind estimate
lands from the answer-key result, lower being better.

On a fully deterministic instrument (96 seeds, 96 experts,
300 items), the dominant lever is *which* rule forms the panel, not its size:
competence-first selection recovers best (0.037), while
representative, single-bloc, and random selection collapse together — *by
construction*, because with independent judge errors composition cannot move an
estimator that only sees agreement. Supplying the missing channel — same-group judges
sharing a latent, marginal-accuracy-preserving error confound — makes the strategies
fan out monotonically as within-bloc coupling rises: representative sortition stays
flat while single-bloc selection degrades, the gap widening from 0.000 to
0.112. Within this instrument the relationship is closed-form: recovery
error tracks the panel's **Herfindahl concentration index** over the axis a shared
error rides on — minimized exactly by a balanced (representative) draw, maximized by a
single bloc — and a continuous representativeness dial confirms error rises
monotonically with it.

The protection is **conditional**: re-keying the confound to an axis the lottery does
not balance erases the protection (0.147→0.229). The
lesson for selecting and evaluating panels is thus a falsifiable, simulation-bounded
prediction, not a preference for any one rule — representativeness protects blind
recovery precisely when the panel balances the attribute a shared error rides on.
Evidence is synthetic and oracle-scored; in a single small live model
(gemma3:4b) the synthetically-best competence-first rule was the worst,
illustrating that a selection rule validated on parameterized judges need not carry
over to prompted ones — a hypothesis to test, not an established caution. All methods
and documentation are openly available at the public repository

# Introduction: panel formation before blind evaluation

## Blind evaluation begins before the estimator

Evaluating decision-makers without an answer key is a recurring problem: in
crowdsourcing, in ensembles of classifiers, in deliberative bodies, and in any
setting where the truth is expensive, contested, or unavailable at evaluation
time — the problem Dawid and Skene first formalized for observer error-rate
estimation without ground truth
[Dawid and Skene (1979)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2346806).
Later learning-from-crowds work made the same inferential problem operational for
noisy human labels and missing gold standards
[Raykar et al. (2010)](https://jmlr.org/papers/v11/raykar10a.html), and
budget-optimal crowdsourcing work shows why worker reliability, redundancy, and
task assignment cannot be separated when answers are inferred from noisy repeated
judgments rather than gold labels
[Karger et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2013.1235). A parallel line
estimates classifier accuracy *without any labels* by exploiting the structure of
agreements among multiple predictors — logic- and constraint-based
[@platanios2014] and spectral [@parisi2014] — and, like the exact NTQR solver, these
methods lean on an **error-independence** (or low-rank residual-dependence)
assumption whose violation is exactly the failure mode we make tunable here. The
`ntqr` package (v0.8) frames the problem as algebraic logic for unsupervised
evaluation from unlabeled decision data
[Corrada-Emmanuel (2026)](https://pypi.org/project/ntqr/). Our
generative model for *violating* that assumption — same-group judges sharing a
latent shock through a Gaussian copula on a probit-thresholded competence variable —
is the standard construction for correlated binary outcomes [@emrich1991; @nelsen2006],
which lets us preserve each judge's marginal accuracy exactly while dialing
cross-judge error correlation.
Given the joint pattern of agreements and
disagreements among three binary judges, its error-independent (EIE) evaluator
returns the possible logically consistent combinations of item prevalence and
per-judge accuracy that could have produced those votes — *with no labels at
all*.

The `ntqr` evaluator, however, takes the panel as a fixed input. Its claims are
about which evaluations are logically consistent for a given set of judges. The
judges themselves arrive from
*somewhere*: a hiring process, a volunteer pool, a citizens' assembly lottery, a
top-k leaderboard. That upstream step — **panel formation** — is the part this
project studies. Our central question is deliberately one level above NTQR:

> Across matched synthetic population and corpus settings, how do the *strategy
> that forms the panel* and the *size of the panel* change the oracle-referenced
> error of no-answer-key NTQR-style evaluations?

Two scope notes frame everything below. First, *oracle-referenced recovery error*
is the distance between the blind, no-answer-key estimate and the estimate you would
have obtained *with* the answer key — lower is better. Second, NTQR's exact
error-independent evaluator solves for *exactly three* binary judges, so a panel of
any larger size is evaluated as an ensemble of its constituent trios; "panel size,"
throughout, means how many such trios the panel contributes, not a larger joint
solve.

## Application review as the empirical stress test

Application review is the manuscript's concrete empirical stress test because it
combines expert judgment, scarce labels, panel formation, and plausible nuisance
bias in one setting. Studies of academic and grant peer review emphasize that
expert panels are not transparent measurement devices: judgment is field-situated
[Lamont (2009)](https://doi.org/10.4159/9780674054158), replication of review
decisions can be fragile [Peters and Ceci (1982)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00011183),
reviewer agreement can be low even on the same proposals
[Cole et al. (1981)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.7302566);
[Pier et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1714379115), and statistical
analysis of NIH review scores shows that panel-scoring uncertainty can materially
change which proposals would be funded
[Johnson (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0804538105). Productivity follow-up
work adds a separate caution: NIH peer-review percentile scores can be weak
predictors of grant productivity
[Fang et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13323),
and peer-review bias is a documented design concern rather than an exotic failure
mode [Lee et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22784);
[Tomkins et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1707323114);
[Helmer et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21718). The postdoctoral
fellowship version is also historically apt: Wennerås and Wold's analysis of
postdoctoral fellowship review found nepotism and sexism in peer review
[Wennerås and Wold (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1038/387341a0), while broader
funding studies report racial disparities in award outcomes
[Ginther et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1196783).

Those literatures motivate the *mechanism* we stress-test, not the conclusion.
This project uses fictitious postdoctoral applications and synthetic age metadata
so the hidden quality label is generated independently of age. Age is included as
a protected-attribute nuisance axis because age bias and age-discrimination
effects are documented in employment-relevant settings
[North and Fiske (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167213480043);
[Neumark et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1086/701029). The manuscript therefore
asks a controlled design question, not a policy question: if reviewer expertise
and irrelevant age bias are known in the generator or prompt profile, which
sampling rule best limits oracle-referenced NTQR error and age-conditioned
recommendations?

## Sortition from civic lotteries to evaluator sampling

Sortition — selection by lottery, often with quotas that make the drawn body
mirror the population — is the canonical *fair*, non-comparative panel-formation
rule
[Stone (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199756100.001.0001).
Modern implementations use auditable maximin algorithms
[Flanigan et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03788-6) that
maximize the minimum selection probability subject to representativeness
constraints. Sortition is attractive precisely because it does **not** select on
competence; it selects on representativeness. That makes it a sharp test case for
NTQR: a representative panel is heterogeneous and, by design, *not* curated for
accuracy. Does representativeness help or hurt an estimator that depends on the
statistical independence of judges' errors?

That procedural tension has a long pre-1800 lineage. Aristotle's political
theory treats lot and election as constitutional signals — lot as democratic,
election as oligarchic — while the Athenian institutional account describes
juries and offices allocated by lot
[Aristotle (Politics)](https://topostext.org/work/100);
[Aristotle (Athenian Constitution)](https://topostext.org/work/99). Medieval and
early-modern writers kept the same problem visible under different vocabularies:
[Aquinas (Summa Theologiae II-II q.95 a.8)](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3095.htm#article8)
distinguished practical uses of lots from divinatory misuse, and
[Contarini (1599)](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp14764)
described Venetian mixed selection machinery as an anti-factional civic design.
Enlightenment writers then made the lot-versus-choice contrast explicit again:
[Montesquieu (1748)](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/montesquieu-complete-works-vol-1-the-spirit-of-laws)
and [Rousseau (1762)](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/cole-the-social-contract-and-discourses)
both distinguish election by lot from election by choice. We cite these sources
as procedural history, not as direct empirical precedent: this manuscript does not
claim that Athenian juries, Venetian offices, or scholastic accounts of chance
anticipate NTQR. They do show that the upstream choice between lot, choice,
status, and asserted competence is an old institutional design problem.

Randomness is already a serious proposal in adjacent research-funding design, but
usually at a different point in the pipeline: collective-allocation and
modified-lottery proposals address how funds might be allocated after review or
thresholding [Bollen et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1002/embr.201338068);
[Fang and Casadevall (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00422-16). Lottery
arguments also arise from the maverick-science problem: if high-variance projects
are hard to rank reliably, randomized allocation can be an epistemic risk-control
device rather than only an administrative convenience
[Avin (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2018.11.006). This
manuscript moves the lottery upstream. It asks how reviewer *sampling* changes an
unlabeled evaluator before any funding decision is made.

The tension is not artificial. Classical jury-theorem results make group accuracy
depend on competence, independence, and aggregation rule
[Grofman et al. (1983)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00125672), while diversity
results show that heterogeneous problem-solving groups can outperform
ability-selected groups under specific search conditions
[Hong and Page (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0403723101). Deliberative
public-consultation work likewise treats representative participation as a
normative and epistemic design choice, not just a sampling convenience
[Fishkin (2009)](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/when-the-people-speak-9780199604432).
The formal voting-theory lineage is also historical rather than merely modern:
[Borda (1781)](https://bibbase.org/network/publication/denbspborda-mmoiresurleslectionsauscrutin-1781)
proposed a scored ballot for elections, and
[Condorcet (1785)](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RzAVAAAAQAAJ) analyzed the
probability of correct plurality decisions. Those works mostly take the voters or
jurors as given. The present instrument asks the upstream question they leave
exogenous: how does the rule that forms the evaluator panel change the blind
recovery problem before aggregation begins?
This manuscript does not assume which rationale wins under NTQR; it measures the
trade-off in a controlled binary-evaluation instrument.

We compare four panel-formation strategies against each other and against the
supervised oracle: auditable representative sortition, uniform random selection
(the honest baseline), single-bloc ideological selection (a deliberately
correlated, non-representative comparator), and competence-first expertise
thresholding. The oracle and the strong baselines are first-class comparators, not
strawmen — the point of the instrument is to *measure*, including measuring our own
preferred narrative against an honest null.

## Falsifiable claims and negative controls

We state the study as five falsifiable hypotheses (H1–H5) and let the regenerated
artifacts adjudicate each. The synthetic deterministic track tests H1–H4 against a
known oracle; the live single-model companion tests H5. Methods (Table
@tbl:falsification) states the load-bearing assumption and the negative-control
check behind each, and the Discussion returns an explicit verdict hypothesis by
hypothesis.

1. **H1 — Formation strategy is the dominant lever.** Different panel-formation
   rules yield materially different oracle-referenced EIE recovery error, even at a
   fixed population and panel size. *Tested by* the weighted-mean strategy ranking
   with a bootstrap separation gate and a power budget ([@fig:ranking]).
2. **H2 — Concentrating correlated bias degrades recovery.** Single-bloc selection,
   which seats judges whose errors are correlated, recovers with higher EIE error
   than a representative draw, because the error-independence assumption NTQR rests
   on is most stressed by a correlated panel. *Tested by* the
   representative-minus-single-bloc contrast across the full regime grid against
   analytical sign predictions ([@fig:repideo]), and resolved by the
   composition-coupled error confound that fans the strategies apart as within-bloc
   coupling rises ([@fig:blocphase]).
3. **H3 — Size is a sampling knob, not guaranteed improvement.** Forming a larger
   ensemble gives more trios to average over, but whether that helps or hurts
   recovery — and whether any effect comes from the larger ensemble violating the
   solver's error-independence assumption more — is an empirical question; the power
   question is how many observations at the analyzed grain would be needed to
   resolve a contrast of the observed magnitude. *Tested by* the per-strategy size
   sweep, a paired regime-controlled size contrast, a per-trio conditioning
   diagnostic, and the power/MDE budgets ([@fig:powercurve], [@fig:powervn],
   [@fig:triocond]).
4. **H4 — Error-correlation is measurable, and recovery degrades with it.** A
   controlled correlation injection produces a realized error-correlation that NTQR
   itself reports, and oracle-referenced recovery error should rise as that
   realized correlation grows. *Tested by* the tolerance sweep, reporting the
   realized-correlation trend and an OLS recovery-vs-correlation slope with a
   bootstrap interval ([@fig:tolerance]); the recovery slope, unresolved by the
   global-injection sweep, is resolved positive once the correlation is
   composition-coupled and marginal-preserving ([@fig:blocphase]).
5. **H5 — The synthetic ranking transfers to a live single-model panel.** The
   strategy ordering measured against the synthetic oracle reproduces when one
   local `gemma3:4b` model is prompted as different reviewers. *Tested by* a
   matched-grain cross-track ranking comparison and cell-level directional
   alignment ([@fig:trackinversion], [@fig:postdocalign]).

These hypotheses are written to be refutable, and the data refute several: H3 and
H5 are rejected; H2 and H4 are unresolved on the baseline grid and resolve only once
correlation is coupled to panel composition; and H1's ranking collapses to
competence-first versus a bunched remainder. The instrument, its resolved cells, its
explicit design-limited cells, and the axis-conditional negative control that keeps
the sortition result honest — not a manufactured sortition win — are the contribution.

# Methods: instrument, assumptions, and companion track

## Synthetic deterministic track: seeded panels, blind estimates, oracle scoring

The first methodological track is a seeded synthetic instrument. It generates
known populations and corpora, hides the answer key from the `ntqr` estimator,
and then scores the returned logically consistent evaluations against the
supervised oracle that is available only because the data are synthetic.

### Pipeline: panel formation precedes no-answer-key estimation

The instrument runs strictly upstream-to-downstream and is deterministic end to
end (every stochastic step is seeded with `numpy.random.default_rng`; figures use
`MPLBACKEND=Agg`). One **trial** is:

1. **Generate** a synthetic expert population of known properties.
2. **Form** a panel from that population with one of four strategies.
3. **Judge** a corpus of items whose ground-truth labels are *known to us but
   hidden from the estimator*.
4. **Evaluate** the panel with the `ntqr` package *without the answer key*.
5. **Score** the unsupervised estimate against the supervised **oracle** computed
   from the known labels.

[@fig:pipeline] shows this upstream-to-downstream flow at a glance.

![Left-to-right pipeline of the deterministic synthetic instrument (steps 1–5 in text; count tokens annotated from `96`, `300`, `8` so the figure cannot drift from the reported configuration): a known population is sampled → a panel is formed by one of four strategies → the panel judges a key-hidden corpus → the EIE evaluator runs blind over trios → only scoring reads the labels. The bracket marks the unsupervised region; the manipulated variable is the upstream formation rule. Explanatory schematic only; quantitative results are in the Results section.](../figures/method_pipeline_schematic.png){#fig:pipeline width=95%}

The key methodological move is step 5: because the ground truth is synthetic and
therefore known, the unlabeled `ntqr` evaluation and the supervised oracle can be
compared on equal footing. Recovery error is the L1-style distance between the two
evaluations — the absolute prevalence error plus the mean absolute per-judge
accuracy error. Throughout, "ground-truth-free" is project shorthand for this
no-answer-key estimator path, not an expansion or alternative name for `ntqr`.

**Synthetic expert population.** Each expert is a noisy binary judge with label-conditional accuracies
`accuracy_a = P(vote a | true a)` and `accuracy_b = P(vote b | true b)`, derived
from a continuous `expertise` (mean precision) and a signed `bias` that skews
errors toward one label. The population sampler draws expertise from a normal
centered at `mean_expertise` with standard deviation `expertise_heterogeneity`, and
draws bias with a sign **correlated with each expert's ideology** (left → negative,
right → positive). Because this only shifts each judge's *marginal* accuracy by
ideology — every judge still errs from an independent stream — it does not by itself
make single-bloc panels more error-correlated than a representative draw; supplying
that missing cross-judge error-correlation channel is the job of the
composition-coupled confound introduced below. Each population in the sweep has
96 experts; each corpus has 300 items sampled at the configured
prevalence.

### Panel-formation strategies: four upstream rules

All four strategies are deterministic given their seed.

- **representative_sortition** — an auditable maximin lottery implemented on the
  open-source `allotment` engine
  ([Citizen-Infra (2024)](https://github.com/Citizen-Infra/allotment), the
  AGPL-3.0 sortition library this project imports and uses directly), which
  realizes the fair stratified-selection algorithm of
  [Flanigan et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03788-6). Ideology
  quotas are set by largest-remainder (Hamilton)
  apportionment so the panel mirrors the population's ideology composition as
  closely as integer seats allow; the draw carries the engine's SHA-256 audit hash
  for reproducibility.
- **random_selection** — a uniform draw without replacement. This is the simplest
  honest baseline and is treated as a first-class comparator throughout.
- **ideological_selection** — fill the panel from a single ideology bloc first,
  spilling over only if the bloc is too small. This deliberately concentrates
  correlated biases and is the *non-representative* comparator.
- **expertise_threshold** — select the top-k experts by expertise. This is the
  competence-first comparator and ignores representativeness entirely.

### NTQR evaluation: trio EIE, oracle scoring, and majority voting

The `ntqr` package's exact error-independent evaluator is **trio-only**: it solves
the error-independent algebraic system for *exactly three* binary judges, returning
logically consistent (prevalence, per-judge accuracy) evaluations. The system
admits up to two real solutions; complex or non-finite roots are dropped honestly
rather than coerced. To resolve the two-fold ambiguity in the synthetic track we
select the consistent solution **closest to the oracle** — this is the most
charitable reading of the unlabeled estimate, so any residual error is a real
failure to match the supervised oracle, not a sign ambiguity.

We compute two `ntqr` evaluations per trio: the error-independent evaluation (EIE,
our headline) and the majority-voting evaluation (a comparator that partitions
solutions into crowd-right and crowd-wrong). The **supervised oracle** is read
directly from the label-conditioned vote counts; it is always real and finite,
and a degenerate oracle is treated as a contract violation that fails loudly.

**Ensemble-of-trios for panels larger than three.** Because the exact solver is trio-only, a panel of size greater than three is
evaluated by **ensemble-of-trios**. We scan trios (combinations of panel members)
in deterministic order, collecting up to 8 *usable* trios — a trio is
skipped if its vote pattern admits no real error-independent solution — and average
their oracle-referenced errors. A single bad expert therefore does not starve the
ensemble. If *every* trio in a panel is degenerate, the trial records an honest NaN
(zero usable trios) so a sweep surfaces "no recovery possible here" rather than
crashing or inventing a number. A panel of exactly three reduces to a single trio,
so the ensemble result coincides with the single-trio result there.

Historically, Borda- and Condorcet-style work asks how votes should be aggregated
once a voting body exists; here, the formation rule is part of the experimental
treatment. The Methods therefore keep two objects separate throughout: the
upstream panel draw and the downstream no-answer-key estimator.

### Companion diagnostics: alarm cost, ternary feasibility, and maximin fairness

Three companion tracks measure structural properties of the instrument rather than
oracle-referenced recovery error.

**Alarm scaling is a small-$Q$ constraint.** The `ntqr` package also ships an **alarm**: it tests whether all judges can be
simultaneously consistent with some answer key at a stated safety specification,
a constraint system that gains more panel-size-indexed checks as judges are added.
Unlike the trio evaluator, this project's alarm path enumerates the answer-key
simplex, and our local benchmark shows roughly **cubic scaling in the corpus size
$Q$**. A shipped benchmark
(`scripts/bench_alarm.py`) reproduces this scaling on demand; indicative
single-machine timings rise from about 0.7 s at $Q=20$ to
8.9 s at $Q=50$ to 97.9 s at $Q=100$ (the exact constants
vary with machine load — the cubic *scaling*, not the constants, is the robust
local finding). This $O(Q^3)$ cost is a scaling limit on the statistical-power /
alarm track as implemented here, so we report it as a finding and cap any alarm
use at $Q\leq30$ (opt-in only); larger corpora must raise the cap
deliberately.

**The ternary $R=3$ axiom-consistency track (consistency only).** A companion track (`src/ntqr_allotment/ternary.py`) extends the axiomatic surface
from binary ($R=2$) to ternary ($R=3$) responses, but **only at the level of
axiom-consistency and feasibility — never $R=3$ recovery**. It checks whether an
observed three-way vote profile is *consistent* with the NTQR algebraic axioms
(the response counts sum correctly and lie in the feasible simplex), not whether
the unsupervised (prevalence, accuracy) state can be *solved*. Exact $R=3$ recovery
is unsolved upstream and is explicitly **out of scope / anti-vision** for this
work: we make no claim to recover ternary evaluations. The track exists so the
consistency/feasibility axioms can be exercised and tested at $R=3$ without
overstating what NTQR can do there.

**N-judge alarm power is consistency-only.** A second companion track (`src/ntqr_allotment/ensemble.py`) generalizes the
single-trio consistency check to an **N-judge** observed-vote-count alarm and
measures how the consistency signal scales with panel size (`alarm_power_curve`).
In the current small-$Q$ diagnostic, the tight safety setting is already saturated
across the plotted panel sizes, so the figure demonstrates that the N-judge alarm
is executable and panel-size-indexed rather than establishing a monotone growth
law. The underlying answer-key enumeration is the same $O(Q^3)$ cost described
above, so the N-judge track is exercised only at **small $Q$**. It is a
panel-size-indexed *consistency* signal, not a recovery method.

**Maximin fairness is a selection metric.** The representative-sortition strategy is an auditable maximin lottery, and a
fairness track (`src/ntqr_allotment/fairness.py`) characterizes the allotment's
**selection-probability distribution** over the population — the probability each
expert is seated across the lottery. The maximin objective is the **minimum
selection probability**: a fairer lottery raises the floor on who can be seated.
This track measures the representation properties of the draw itself and is
independent of the downstream NTQR recovery numbers.

### Notation: cells, trios, and inferential units

The manuscript keeps each statistic tied to the unit that generated it; this is the
guardrail that prevents synthetic, power, and live empirical claims from borrowing
strength from one another. Table @tbl:notation is the compact ledger for symbols,
estimators, inferential units, and artifact ownership.

| Symbol | Surface / estimator | Unit | Aggregation and uncertainty | Source artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $E, Q, \pi$ | Experts, items, and label prevalence hidden from NTQR | one seeded population/corpus | profile metadata, config hash, seed list | `output/data/sweep_results.json` |
| $V_{ij}$ | Binary vote matrix by panel member $i$ and item $j$ | one panel trial | supervised oracle retained only for scoring | `src/ntqr_allotment/pipeline.py` |

### Assumption ledger: how each claim can fail

The analysis is organized as falsifiable claims rather than a single success
story. Table @tbl:falsification states what would count against each claim and
which artifact carries the check. The rows map onto the Introduction's
hypotheses: the representative-vs-ideological, panel-size, tolerance-sweep, and
real-Ollama rows are the negative-control checks for H2, H3, H4, and H5
respectively; the NTQR-EIE-recovery row guards the estimator the whole study
depends on (and so underpins H1, the strategy ranking tested directly in
Results); and the null-and-significance row fixes the design-limited-vs-resolved
interpretation discipline applied throughout.

| Claim family | Load-bearing assumption | Negative-control or falsification check | Current interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NTQR EIE recovery | The three-judge error-independent algebra is the right estimator for a usable trio. | Complex/non-finite roots and every-degenerate panels are retained as failures, not coerced into numbers. | Residual recovery error is scored only after a real logically consistent solution exists. |

### Sweep profiles: profiles, seeds, and aggregation units

The synthetic track is a deterministic grid sweep over the four strategies, panel
sizes, expert stringency, bias spread, and the population/corpus parameters in
`manuscript/config.yaml`. That file now defines named profiles: the reported sweep
uses `manuscript_contrast` (config hash `fda4da941cf0`), while `smoke`,
`manuscript_main`, `tolerance`, `power`, `panel_ladder`, and `research_broad` keep
CI, legacy manuscript, assumption-tolerance, design-budget, finer panel-size, and
broader sensitivity settings explicit. `live_postdoc_panel` separately stores the
required-live Gemma model settings, reviewer/application counts, decode controls,
and vote-cache path. Each reported grid cell is
repeated over 96 seeds; per cell we report the mean EIE error, its sample
standard deviation, and a 95% confidence interval. Degenerate cells (no usable trio)
are excluded from aggregation via the same sentinel the emitter respects. A single
seed is treated as an illustration, never a finding — all reported effects are
seed-aggregated with confidence intervals. The aggregated table
(`output/data/sweep_aggregated.csv`) and per-seed JSON
(`output/data/sweep_results.json`) carry the profile name, config hash, seed list,
and degenerate-row count; manuscript numbers are emitted from those artifacts by
`src/ntqr_allotment/manuscript_variables.py`, so no result is hand-transcribed.

### Controlled-correlation sweep: injected dependence as a diagnostic

The error-independence assumption is probed directly. `dependence.py`'s
`sample_votes_correlated(experts, items, *, rho, seed)` injects a controllable
shared-error latent of strength $\rho$, and `measure_error_correlations` reports the
*realized* pairwise and three-way correlation NTQR itself computes from the votes —
so the knob ($\rho$) and the measured quantity are independent. `independence_sweep.py`
sweeps $\rho$ × strategy at the trio over multiple seeds and aggregates recovery
error against realized correlation (`output/data/independence_sweep.csv`), yielding
the error-correlation **tolerance curve** reported in Results. This correlation
sweep uses its own smaller grid — 24 experts and 120 items, four injected $\rho$
levels by two strategies over up to six seeds per cell (eight non-degenerate ($\rho$, strategy)
cells) — deliberately fixing the panel at the trio (the exact solver's unit) so
panel size cannot confound a trio-level correlation study.

### Composition-coupled confound: when group membership carries shared error

The tolerance sweep above injects correlation *globally*, identically for every
panel, so it cannot test whether *how the panel is formed* changes the correlation
the estimator sees. `bloc_confound.py` supplies that missing channel.
`sample_votes_bloc_correlated(panel_experts, items, *, bloc_correlation, seed,
axis)` drives each judge's correctness through a Gaussian copula whose shared
component is keyed on a grouping attribute: $z_j = \sqrt{\rho}\,g_{\,\mathrm{group}(j)}
+ \sqrt{1-\rho}\,\varepsilon_j$, correct iff $z_j < \Phi^{-1}(\mathrm{acc}_j)$.
Judges in the same group share the standard-normal stream $g$ (keyed by a stable
hash of the group value, so it is identical across panels and worker processes);
judges in different groups stay independent. Because $z_j$ is marginally standard
normal, $P(z_j < \Phi^{-1}(\mathrm{acc})) = \mathrm{acc}$ exactly per label: the
construction is **marginal-accuracy preserving**, so any recovery change is
attributable to error correlation rather than a confounded accuracy shift, and
$\rho=0$ recovers the independent baseline. The inverse-normal $\Phi^{-1}$ uses a
dependency-free Acklam rational approximation. `run_bloc_phase` sweeps strategy ×
$\rho$ × bias-spread × stringency × panel-size × seed (`scripts/run_bloc_phase.py`,
`output/data/bloc_phase.csv`). The default `axis="ideology"` keys the confound on
the axis representative sortition balances; a negative-control grid keys it on
`axis="expertise_tier"`, an axis the lottery does not balance, to test whether the
representative robustness is innate or conditional. Recovery is scored against the
same supervised oracle as the main sweep, and the realized correlation is read back
with the same `measure_error_correlations` diagnostic.

### Herfindahl exposure: concentration predicts shared-error risk

The fan-out is not arbitrary: keying the shared shock on the grouping axis makes a
trio's confound exposure equal to its same-group pair count — the Herfindahl index —
so the composition-to-exposure relationship has a closed-form backbone. That backbone
is a designed, internally-consistent property of this instrument, not an independent
empirical law: the closed form follows *by construction* from how the confound is
keyed. What the simulation then genuinely tests — the falsifiable link — is whether
NTQR's exact recovery actually degrades as that exposure rises. Let a
panel have seat fractions $p_b$ across the confound's grouping axis (here ideology,
with $B$ groups). The probability that two seats drawn with replacement fall in the
same group is the **Herfindahl–Hirschman index** $H = \sum_b p_b^2$
(`theory.herfindahl_index`); for distinct seats it is the finite-panel correction
$\sum_b c_b(c_b-1)/[N(N-1)]$ (`theory.same_group_pair_probability`), and the
expected number of same-group pairs among the three pairs of a trio is three times
that. Because the shared error shock is keyed on the group, a trio's exposure to it
is exactly its same-group pair count. Holding competence fixed, the realized
error-correlation NTQR measures is therefore monotone increasing in $H$, and — since
the exact error-independent solver is the one whose assumption that exposure
violates — so is recovery error. $H$ is minimized at $1/B$ by a perfectly balanced
panel and maximized at $1$ by a single-group panel, which is precisely the
representative-versus-single-bloc axis. The maximin sortition quota makes this
exact: a representative draw attains $H = 1/B$ (here $1/3$), single-bloc selection
attains $H = 1$, and random selection sits between — an ordering that matches their
measured error-correlation ordering cell for cell
(`tests/test_theory.py::test_herfindahl_predicts_strategy_correlation_ordering`).

This also licenses a *continuous* reading of representativeness rather than four
discrete strategies. `bloc_confound.concentration_panel` forms a panel with a dial
$c\in[0,1]$: a fraction $c$ of seats massed in one group and the rest balanced. In
the large-panel limit its Herfindahl index is
$H(c) = (c + \tfrac{1-c}{B})^2 + (B-1)\big(\tfrac{1-c}{B}\big)^2$
(`theory.concentration_herfindahl`), monotone increasing from $1/B$ at $c=0$ to $1$
at $c=1$. Sweeping $c$ at fixed coupling (`run_concentration_sweep`,
`output/data/bloc_concentration.csv`) traces recovery error against the dial and
tests the predicted monotonicity directly ([@fig:dial]). The contribution is thus a
closed-form chain — composition $\to$ Herfindahl exposure $\to$ realized
error-correlation $\to$ no-answer-key recovery error — verified end to end in
simulation, with the conditional caveat (the law is stated over *the confound's*
axis) built in. Operationally this suggests a panel diagnostic that needs no votes
and no answer key: compute a *proposed* panel's concentration index over the
attribute a shared error might ride on. *If* a shared error exists *and* its axis is
known, a lower index over that axis implies lower modeled shared-error exposure in
this instrument. Whether a real shared error exists, and on which axis, is outside
what this simulation establishes — so this is a modeling diagnostic, not a validated
trust signal for real panels.

### Statistical power: separating rankings from resolved contrasts

Because the recurring nulls are computed on bounded per-strategy observation
groups, a power layer (`power_analysis.py`, `power_study.py`) makes design
adequacy explicit, following the standardized-effect and power/sample-size
framework [Cohen (1988)](https://archive.org/details/statisticalpower0000cohe). This
design-budget framing also matches the review-panel literature's concern that reviewer counts and
score precision are design parameters, not afterthoughts
[Kaplan et al. (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002761). The pure-numpy
toolkit provides a normal CDF/PPF checked against published constants, analytic two-sample
power, Monte-Carlo `simulate_power` using the *actual* Welch-t / permutation test,
`sample_size_for_power`, and a minimum-detectable-effect (MDE) solver; each primitive
is bound to an independent reference (analytic vs simulation, Type-I rate vs alpha)
and **no retrospective observed power is ever reported**. `power_study.py` applies this
to every pairwise strategy contrast from the real per-seed sweep
(`output/data/power_analysis.csv`), turning each soft null into an experiment budget
(per-group observations at the analyzed trial/cell grain for 80% power). Separately, `statistics_analysis.strategy_separation`
compares two strategies by their separately bootstrapped mean intervals and emits an
explicit CI-overlap verdict (`separated` / `overlapping`) that must read `separated`
before any "beats" wording is justified. Bootstrap intervals are used as
descriptive uncertainty summaries, following the nonparametric bootstrap framing
of [Efron and Tibshirani (1993)](https://doi.org/10.1201/9780429246593). Because the sweep compares every pair of
strategies, the family of pairwise permutation p-values is corrected with the
Holm-Bonferroni step-down procedure [Holm (1979)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4615733)
(`statistics_analysis.holm_bonferroni`)
before any significance count is reported, controlling the family-wise error rate
without plain Bonferroni's conservatism. The Gemma postdoctoral panel artifact is
reported with descriptive intervals and cell-level directional alignment only; it
is not folded into the synthetic power family and is not reported as retrospective
observed power.

## Real-Ollama reviewer-panel track: single-model live companion

The second methodological track uses one live local language model through
Ollama: `gemma3:4b`. It is deliberately **single-model** and deliberately
not a model-family comparison. The empirical question is whether the same
sampling mechanisms studied analytically — representative sortition, random
selection, same-bias bloc selection, and expertise-threshold selection — remain
visible when one real local LLM is prompted as different postdoctoral-review
panelists.

The live track is therefore closer to an instrumented LLM-judge stress test than
to an ethnography of human review. LLM-as-judge work has shown that prompted model
judgments can be useful but also vulnerable to evaluator-specific artifacts such
as position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases
[Zheng et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685); systematic position-bias
tests likewise show that judge outputs can change with answer order rather than
only answer quality
[Shi et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.ijcnlp-long.18). Broader language-model
risk work likewise warns against treating fluent model output as an unmediated
measurement of social reality [Bender et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922).
We use one model, bounded decoding, serialized provenance, and synthetic
applicant/reviewer metadata precisely so the empirical surface remains auditable
and does not masquerade as human-review validation. The two tracks are kept
strictly separate and their evidence is never pooled: the synthetic deterministic
track remains the controlled spine, while the live track is a companion stress test
with separate artifacts, a separate config hash (`5161ffe474b3`), and
separate caveats — neither supplies evidence for the other's claims.

### Postdoctoral corpus: protected-attribute stress test

The empirical setting is a fictitious postdoctoral fellowship review panel. Each
application has generated dossier text, a hidden latent quality label used only for
oracle scoring, and synthetic age metadata in the range configured by
`live_postdoc_panel`. True latent quality is generated independently of age by
default. Age is therefore a nuisance/protected-attribute stress test: any
age-conditioned recommendation shift is reviewer bias expression, not signal.
We report the observable older-minus-younger recommendation-rate disparity as a
diagnostic in the spirit of protected-attribute error-rate auditing
[Hardt et al. (2016)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/hash/9d2682367c3935defcb1f9e247a97c0d-Abstract.html)
(age is a probe, not an endorsement; see Ethics).

### Reviewer profiles: expertise and age-bias prompts

Each synthetic reviewer has an expertise level and an irrelevant age-bias factor.
Positive age bias means the reviewer erroneously favors older applicants; negative
age bias means the reviewer erroneously favors younger applicants. Expertise
controls sensitivity to merit evidence. The `ideological_selection` strategy key is
kept internally for compatibility with the synthetic pipeline, but in the
postdoctoral panel it is displayed as **same-bias selection**: a deliberately
non-representative bloc that concentrates one bias direction.

`scripts/run_postdoc_panel.py` first runs the analytical postdoc vote model and
then, unless explicitly asked for an offline smoke run, runs the live Gemma panel
against Ollama with `--require-live`. The manuscript-facing configuration uses
12 seeds, 48 synthetic reviewers,
72 fictitious applications per seed, panel sizes
3, 6, 4 sampling strategies,
temperature 0.2, `num_predict=1`, and timeout
20.0 s. Vote-cache keys include the config hash, seed, reviewer id,
application id, model digest, and decode parameters, so interrupted live runs can
resume without mixing incompatible votes.

### Postdoc aggregation: analytical-vs-Gemma alignment

For each sampled panel, selected reviewers vote on the same fictitious
applications. Panels of size greater than three are evaluated with the same
ensemble-of-trios rule as the synthetic track: usable trios are passed through the
exact three-classifier EIE and majority-vote evaluators, scored against the hidden
oracle, and averaged. The live artifact records per-seed/per-strategy/per-size EIE
error, majority-vote error, usable-trio counts, degeneracy counts,
older-minus-younger recommendation-rate disparity, panel composition, model digest,
decode parameters, and vote-cache provenance in
`output/data/postdoc_panel_results.json`. The companion
`output/data/postdoc_panel_alignment.json` compares analytical and Gemma directional
signs cell by cell and marks unresolved cells explicitly. A generated local web
explorer (`output/web/ntqr_explorer.html`) is a non-publishing reader/QA aid over
these same source artifacts; it exposes filters and source tables but does not change
the PDF claim boundary, and a statistic is eligible for manuscript prose only after
it is regenerated into the static artifacts and the token/caption contract.

# Results: what resolved and what stayed bounded

Numbers below are token-injected by
`src/ntqr_allotment/manuscript_variables.py` from the artifact named in each
section: `sweep_aggregated.csv` for strategy and size summaries,
`independence_sweep.csv` for tolerance, `postdoc_panel_results.json` and
`postdoc_panel_alignment.json` for the live Gemma reviewer-panel companion,
`power_analysis.csv` / `sweep_results.json` for design budgets, and
`alarm_timings.csv` for alarm timing. None are hand-transcribed. Errors are mean
EIE recovery error against the supervised oracle, aggregated over 96
seeds in the active sweep profile.

This section adjudicates the five hypotheses from the Introduction. H1, H3, and
H5 each resolve in one subsection. H2 and H4 are addressed in two stages: first
against the baseline grid (where, by construction, both are design-limited because
the baseline judges err independently), then resolved together by the
composition-coupled confound. Remaining subsections report supporting diagnostics.
The Discussion returns the per-hypothesis verdicts.

## Synthetic deterministic results: controlled spine for H1-H4

The synthetic results are generated from seeded populations and corpora with a
known oracle. They support strategy, regime, tolerance, power-budget, alarm, and
diagnostic claims for the active deterministic profile only. Throughout, a *regime*
is one (expert-stringency × bias-spread × panel-size) cell of the sweep grid
(sixteen cells in the active profile); contrasts are evaluated cell by cell and
averaged only where the text says so.

### Formation strategy sets the recovery floor

**H1 (formation strategy is the dominant lever).** The strategies do not fan out
into a graded four-way ranking; instead one rule stands far apart and the other
three collapse together ([@fig:ranking]). Competence-first selection recovers at
mean EIE error 0.037 — roughly a quarter of the error of
any other rule — while representative sortition, random selection, and single-bloc
ideological selection are **statistically indistinguishable from one another**,
clustered at 0.147–0.148:

| Strategy | Mean EIE error | 95% CI |
| -------- | -------------- | ------ |
| expertise threshold (far best) | 0.037 | ±0.003 |
| representative sortition | 0.147 | ±0.014 |
| random selection | 0.148 | ±0.014 |
| single-bloc ideological selection | 0.148 | ±0.015 |

![Horizontal bars give the mean oracle-referenced EIE recovery error for each of the four panel-formation strategies, ordered best (lowest, top) to worst (highest, bottom); the whiskers are 95% confidence intervals over 96 seeds and the value beside each bar is the mean +/- half-interval, all from source `output/data/sweep_aggregated.csv` (profile manuscript_contrast, hash fda4da941cf0). Read it as the ceiling each upstream choice imposes on the downstream blind estimator: competence-first selection sits far left (near-zero error) while the other three strategies cluster together to its right. Claim: the upstream formation rule, not the estimator, sets the no-answer-key error ceiling, and the competence-first-vs-rest gap dwarfs anything the estimator does on a fixed panel; caveat: only the competence-first separation is resolved — representative, random, and single-bloc selection are statistically indistinguishable from one another, as the power/separation layer certifies.](../figures/strategy_ranking.png){#fig:ranking width=75%}

The dominant lever is therefore *whether the panel is curated for competence at
all*, not a graded property of the formation rule. The competence-first-vs-sortition
contrast is a **resolved** separation on this instrument: the trio-level bootstrap
separation gate reads **separated** (means 0.037
vs 0.122), the two strategies' pooled confidence intervals in the table
above are disjoint (0.037 ± 0.003
versus 0.147 ± 0.014),
and the power analysis resolves it as **significant**
(well-powered, not design-limited). Every contrast *among* the other three is, by
contrast, design-indistinguishable — including the representative-vs-single-bloc
pair, whose effect is inconclusive (its 95% CI crosses zero,
inconclusive (95% CI crosses zero)). So competence-first selection beats the representative
draw by a resolved interval, but representativeness, randomness, and single-bloc
concentration are interchangeable for recovery on this instrument — a sharper and
more honest result than a four-way ranking would suggest.

### Sortition only separates when the confound rides on the balanced axis

**H2 (concentrating correlated error degrades recovery).** [@fig:repideo] reports
the single-bloc-minus-representative EIE error contrast across the full active regime
grid. Positive cells mean the representative draw has lower post-NTQR recovery error.
The axes expose the design levers directly: expert stringency (`mean_expertise`),
ideological bias spread (`bias_std`), and sortition size (`panel_size`).

![Faceted heatmaps of the single-bloc-minus-representative EIE error contrast across expert stringency (mean expertise, rows), ideological bias spread (columns), and panel size (one facet per size), from source `output/data/sweep_aggregated.csv` (profile manuscript_contrast, hash fda4da941cf0), with analytical sign predictions overlaid from `output/data/analytical_predictions.json`. Colour encodes the signed contrast on a diverging scale centred at zero: positive (red) cells mean the representative draw recovers with lower error than the single-bloc draw in that regime, negative (blue) the reverse. Statistic: cell-level mean contrast over 96 seeds; stars mark descriptive 95% intervals excluding zero. Read across a row to see how stringency modulates the gap and down a column to see the effect of bias concentration. Claim: the representative-vs-single-bloc distinction is not a single number but is regime-dependent, becoming visible only as bias, stringency, and size are jointly varied; caveat: the intervals are descriptive and synthetic-profile bounded, and they are deliberately not pooled with the real Ollama evidence, which lives in the separate Gemma postdoc companion in [@fig:postdocrank], [@fig:postdocbias], and [@fig:postdocalign].](../figures/rep_vs_ideo_heatmap.png){#fig:repideo width=92%}

On this baseline grid the contrast is design-limited and must be read cell by cell:
the analytical prediction is directional (single-bloc ideological selection should
not beat representative sortition when bias is the manipulated dependence source),
and the heatmap shows where the regenerated synthetic data aligns, where it remains
uncertain, and where the active design is too small to resolve a sign. This grid
cannot fan the strategies apart because it never realizes H2's premise — its judges
err independently; the composition-coupled confound that supplies the missing
channel, and resolves H2, is reported in §Composition-coupled correlation fans the
strategies apart.

### NTQR beats majority voting only in selected regimes

For the pre/post comparison, "pre-NTQR" means the supervised majority-vote
baseline already stored as `mv_error`; "post-NTQR" means the ground-truth-free EIE
recovery error stored as `eie_error`. [@fig:prepost] plots `EIE - MV`, so negative
cells mean the NTQR recovery estimate is closer to the supervised oracle than the
majority-vote baseline for that regime.

![Faceted heatmaps contrasting the post-NTQR error-independent estimate against the pre-NTQR supervised majority-vote baseline, broken out by strategy, panel size, expert stringency, and bias spread, from source `output/data/analytical_predictions.json`, derived in turn from `output/data/sweep_aggregated.csv` (profile manuscript_contrast, hash fda4da941cf0). Colour encodes the signed difference on a diverging scale: negative (blue) cells are where the blind NTQR recovery lands closer to the oracle than the majority-vote baseline did, positive (red) where it does not. Statistic: cell-level mean difference over 96 seeds; metric is `eie_mean - mv_mean`, so the figure isolates what the estimator adds (or costs) on top of naive voting. Claim: panel size and bias act on each formation strategy differently before and after NTQR recovery, so there is no uniform pre/post improvement; caveat: this is oracle-referenced simulation on synthetic labels, not a live-judge validation claim.](../figures/pre_post_ntqr_heatmap.png){#fig:prepost width=95%}

The companion alignment map ([@fig:theoryalign]) makes the analytical layer
auditable rather than rhetorical. Each cell reports how many expertise levels in
that size-bias slice match the directional prediction that
ideological-minus-representative EIE should be positive. The same JSON artifact
also records the monotone checks for bias and expertise.

![Audit heatmap of how often the analytical directional predictions match the regenerated synthetic cells, from source `output/data/analytical_predictions.json`. Each cell of a panel-size x bias-spread slice reports the count of expertise levels whose observed contrast sign agrees with the predicted sign; darker cells mean more of the expertise levels in that slice align with the prediction. Statistic: aligned expertise-level cells per panel-size x bias slice, over source sweep profile manuscript_contrast, 96 seeds. The figure exists to make the analytical layer falsifiable rather than rhetorical: a prediction that systematically disagreed with the data would show as pale cells. Claim: analytical expectations are checked against regenerated artifacts rather than asserted in prose; caveat: the predictions are directional and order constraints only, not closed-form numerical EIE laws, so partial agreement is expected and is reported honestly.](../figures/theory_vs_observed_alignment.png){#fig:theoryalign width=72%}

### Larger panels are a neutral sampling knob here

**H3 (size is a sampling knob, not a uniform improvement).** [@fig:powercurve]
plots EIE error against panel/ensemble size for each strategy. If size were a clean
power knob, every curve would fall from size 3 to size 6. It does not:

| Strategy | Size 3 | Size 6 | Pooled direction |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ---------------- |
| expertise threshold | 0.037 | 0.038 | roughly flat |
| representative sortition | 0.122 | 0.154 | error rises |
| random selection | 0.118 | 0.155 | error rises |
| ideological selection | 0.124 | 0.151 | error rises |

![One line per panel-formation strategy tracing mean EIE recovery error against panel/ensemble size (3, 6, 9, 12 members), from source `output/data/sweep_results.json`, aggregated over 96 seeds with per-point 95% confidence intervals and a colour-matched end-label summarising each curve's trio-to-six-seat direction. If size were a clean power knob every curve would fall monotonically left to right; instead the curves cross. Read the vertical spread at any size as the strategy gap and each curve's slope as the strategy-specific effect of adding experts. Claim: a paired regime-controlled test (`paired_size_contrast`) resolves a trio-to-six-seat size effect for three of the four strategies, but every resolved increase is tiny and single-bloc is within noise, so size is essentially neutral at this grid and the dominant lever is which strategy forms the panel; caveat: this pooled curve marginalizes over sixteen regimes and is bounded to the active sweep profile.](../figures/power_curve.png){#fig:powercurve width=75%}

Those Size-3/Size-6 cells and the figure's end-labels are **pooled point
estimates** over sixteen regimes. The powered test is a **paired** contrast that
matches each regime-and-seed cell across the two sizes (`paired_size_contrast` in
`src/ntqr_allotment/power_study.py`), removing the between-regime variance. Under
that test 3 of the four strategies show a *resolved*
trio-to-six-seat change, and every resolved change is a small **increase** in
error: random selection (+0.015, 95% CI
[+0.009, +0.021]), representative sortition
(+0.007, CI
[+0.001, +0.012]), and competence-first selection
(+0.004, CI [+0.003, +0.005]);
only single-bloc selection (-0.003, CI
[-0.007, +0.002]) is within noise. These effects are
**resolved but negligible** — the largest, +0.015,
is about a tenth of the bottom-tier baseline near 0.148. So
more experts do not help, and at most very slightly hurt: we reject the simple
hypothesis that more experts always help, but the honest reading is that **size is
essentially neutral** at this grid, and the dominant lever is **strategy**, not
size.

**What the size diagnostic rules out.** The error-independent solver assumes the
three judges' errors are uncorrelated, so the natural guess is that larger panels
feed the ensemble more error-correlated trios. A per-trio diagnostic refutes that
guess ([@fig:triocond], `src/ntqr_allotment/trio_conditioning.py`, over
17,126 usable trios). The realized mean absolute pairwise
error-correlation — the quantity the solver assumes is zero — is
**essentially flat** across the size ladder for every strategy
(0.0087 at the trio to 0.0101 at twelve seats), so
enlarging the panel does not feed the ensemble more correlated trios. Correlation
*is* a relevant axis — within a strategy, higher-correlation trios recover worse
(Pearson up to +0.70 for competence-first) — but because correlation does not
grow with size, it does not identify a positive mechanism for the tiny paired size
deltas. No single per-trio summary statistic (correlation, judge accuracy, or scan
position) predicts the per-trio error strongly enough to pin the remaining cost on
worse judges. We therefore report the small paired size deltas after ruling out the
main correlation explanation, not as an affirmative aggregation effect.

Panel A plots the mean absolute pairwise error-correlation of the usable trios against panel size, one line per formation strategy, with a dashed reference at zero (the value the error-independent solver assumes); every line holds the small 0.0087-to-0.0105 baseline rather than rising, so enlarging the panel does not pull in more error-correlated trios. Panel B plots the within-strategy Pearson correlation between a trio's recovery error and its absolute error-correlation; the bars are positive (up to +0.70 for competence-first), so correlation genuinely predicts per-trio error — it simply does not grow with size. Statistic: mean absolute error-correlation by size (A) and within-strategy Pearson of per-trio error against absolute error-correlation (B), measured over the same usable trios the ensemble-of-trios averages.

### Global injected correlation is measurable but recovery-limited

**H4 (error-correlation is measurable; recovery should degrade with it).** The
centerpiece measurement injects a controlled error-correlation $\rho$ into a
trio's votes, measures the *realized* correlation NTQR itself reports
(`mean_abs_pair`), computes the unlabeled EIE evaluation, and scores it against
the supervised oracle (`output/data/independence_sweep.csv`, produced by
`src/ntqr_allotment/independence_sweep.py`). The robust, monotone finding is that
**the realized correlation rises with the injected $\rho$**: averaged over the
non-degenerate cells it climbs from 0.019 at the lowest injected $\rho$
to 0.123 at the highest. The injection knob does what it claims —
it manufactures measurable error-correlation, and NTQR's own correlation
diagnostic registers it.

![Oracle-referenced EIE error (y-axis) versus the realized pairwise error correlation $\rho_{\mathrm{NTQR}}$ that the NTQR estimator itself measures from the votes (x-axis), shown as a scatter with one point per non-degenerate ($\rho$, strategy) cell of the tolerance sweep, from source `output/data/independence_sweep.csv`. The x-axis is the quantity the exact solver assumes is zero; the controlled injection knob moves points rightward, which verifies the diagnostic, while the y-axis tests whether more correlation actually costs recovery accuracy. Claim: injected $\rho$ creates measurable NTQR error correlation (points do move right), but the fitted recovery-error trend is unresolved at this grid; statistic: OLS error-vs-correlation slope -0.145 with 95% bootstrap CI [-4.335, 0.911], which crosses zero; caveat: this figure supports the correlation diagnostic only, not a resolved recovery-effect law.](../figures/error_vs_correlation.png){#fig:tolerance width=75%}

Recovery error against the oracle, by contrast, shows **no detectable monotone
relationship** with that correlation on this grid. The sweep fixes the panel at
the trio (the exact solver's unit) and varies only $\rho$ and strategy over up to
six seeds per cell, so each ($\rho$, strategy) contributes one independent cell to the
regression — no size-invariant duplicate trio is double-counted. The
ordinary-least-squares slope of recovery error on realized correlation across
those unique cells is -0.145, but its 95% bootstrap confidence
interval is [-4.335, 0.911] — it **crosses zero**. The honest verdict is
therefore that the fitted slope is **statistically indistinguishable from zero** at this
24-expert / 120-item grid. Crucially this is an
*unresolved* result, not evidence of *no* effect: a CI that spans zero is
consistent with a small positive slope, a small negative one, or none, and this
grid is simply too small to choose between them (mean EIE error 0.367 at
the lowest injected `rho` and 0.228 at the highest, with a
non-monotone dip in between). We report the interval rather than a
bare point estimate precisely because a single noisy slope on eight cells would
overclaim a precision the data do not support.

What the instrument *does* establish here is narrower and robust: the realized
correlation tracks the injected correlation (the monotone rise above). The
*analytical* expectation encoded in `theory.py`
(`predicted_error_vs_correlation`) is that recovery error should **not decrease**
as positive error-correlation grows, because correlation violates the
error-independence the exact solver assumes. That expectation is **not confirmed
on this global-injection grid**: `independence_sweep.csv` shows a slight,
non-monotone *decrease* (0.367 at the lowest injected `rho` to
0.228 at the highest, slope 95% CI crossing zero). We now attribute
that non-monotonicity to a **disclosed limitation of this particular injection
model**, not to small-grid noise alone: `dependence.sample_votes_correlated` mixes
a shared and an independent *uniform* latent, and a convex combination of uniforms
is not uniform, so the model's realized per-judge accuracy is **not preserved as
`rho` varies** — it inflates and then deflates, peaking near `rho=0.5`. That
accuracy confound moves recovery error in its own right and contaminates the
recovery-vs-correlation slope. Rather than re-engineer this diagnostic (which would
perturb a shipped result), we draw the H4 recovery conclusion from the
**marginal-accuracy-preserving composition-coupled instrument** of the following
subsection (§Composition-coupled correlation fans the strategies apart), which holds
each judge's accuracy fixed by construction and resolves the recovery-vs-correlation
relationship in the affirmative ([@fig:blocphase]). The global-injection sweep
remains in the paper as the correlation *diagnostic* (the realized correlation does
rise with `rho`) with its accuracy artifact disclosed. This is a
**measured behaviour under controlled correlation**,
validated in simulation only; it does *not* show that sortition restores low
oracle-referenced error on real prompted judges. The live Gemma postdoctoral-review
panel that probes the same sampling mechanism on a local LLM is reported in the
Real-Ollama results subsection.

### Composition-coupled correlation exposes the sortition mechanism

The H4 slope above is unresolved for a specific, fixable reason. The tolerance
sweep injects a *global* correlation onto a *fixed* trio, identically for every
strategy, so it measures sensitivity to correlation **decoupled from how the panel
was formed**. That is the wrong instrument for H2, whose premise is that
single-bloc selection *seats judges whose errors are correlated* — a premise the
baseline generator never realizes, because there ideology shifts only each judge's
*marginal* accuracy and every judge errs from an independent stream. Under that
generator representative, random, and single-bloc panels are indistinguishable not
by coincidence but **by construction**: the channel that would separate them does
not exist, so no parameter sweep over the baseline can fan them out.

We close that gap with a composition-coupled confound
(`src/ntqr_allotment/bloc_confound.py`). Judges who share an ideological bloc draw
a shared latent *error shock* through a Gaussian copula of within-group strength
$\rho$; the construction preserves each judge's per-label accuracy exactly, so any
change in recovery is attributable to error *correlation*, not to an accuracy
shift, and $\rho=0$ reproduces the independent baseline. (The shared channel is a
symmetric competence shock, not directional bias. $\rho$ is the latent within-group
correlation; what we plot as "realized correlation" is NTQR's own
label-conditional error-correlation statistic, which is much smaller in magnitude
than $\rho$ — we report the quantity the solver assumes is zero, never the latent
$\rho$.) We sweep $\rho$ across 7 levels,
aggregating on average 239 non-degenerate trials per (strategy, $\rho$) point over
bias-spread, stringency, panel-size, and seed regimes ([@fig:blocphase]).

The result is a clean, graded fan-out. At $\rho=0$ the three composition
strategies collapse exactly as the baseline reported — the
ideological-minus-representative gap is 0.000. As coupling rises they fan
out: representative sortition stays essentially flat
(0.156 to 0.155 EIE
error), random selection degrades (0.157 to
0.190), and single-bloc ideological selection degrades most
(0.156 to 0.267), widening
the gap to 0.112 at $\rho=0.90$. NTQR's own correlation
diagnostic makes the mechanism legible: at high coupling a representative trio
carries measured error-correlation 0.018 while
a single-bloc trio carries 0.129 — bloc-balancing
*decorrelates* the shared shock that bloc-concentration *concentrates*. This
resolves **H2** (concentrating correlated error does degrade recovery, once the
correlation is composition-coupled) and answers the open **H4** recovery slope in
the affirmative under a correctly specified, marginal-preserving instrument. It is
not a pooling artifact: in a paired per-regime test at $\rho=0.90$,
single-bloc error exceeds representative error in 180/205 matched
regimes (paired mean 0.102, 95% CI ±0.012). Nor is the
averaged subsample cherry-picked by the degenerate-trio skip: at high coupling the
single-bloc panels have the *lowest* degenerate-trio rate of the four strategies
(tracked per strategy in `bloc_phase_summary.json`), so dropping ill-posed trios
cannot be what manufactures their degradation — if anything it makes the reported
gap conservative.

This robustness is **conditional, not magical**, and a negative control says so.
The protection appears because representative sortition balances the very axis —
ideology — that the confound rides on. When the shared shock is re-keyed to an
orthogonal axis the lottery does *not* balance (expertise tier), representative
sortition loses its immunity: its error climbs from 0.147 to
0.229, and the large ideological-minus-representative gap of the
matched axis (0.112 at $\rho=0.90$) nearly closes under the
orthogonal one (0.026). The point is not that some *other* strategy
inherits the protection — competence-first selection draws the top experts, who
span expertise tiers, so it does not maximally concentrate the tier axis either —
but that representativeness on ideology stops mattering once the confound no longer
rides on ideology. The defensible claim is therefore precise: **balancing a panel
on the axis a shared error rides on preserves no-answer-key recovery; balancing the
wrong axis does not.** That is a statement about sortition design in simulation, not
a blanket endorsement of representative panels.

Left: mean oracle-referenced EIE recovery error (y) versus within-bloc error coupling $\rho$ (x), one line per panel-formation strategy with 95% CI bands; the lines coincide at $\rho=0$ (the reproduced baseline collapse) and fan out as $\rho$ rises, representative sortition staying flat while single-bloc ideological selection climbs. Right: the NTQR-measured realized trio error correlation (y) versus $\rho$ — the mechanism — showing representative sortition suppressing the shared confound (flat, low) while single-bloc selection concentrates it (steeply rising). Claim: composition-coupled error correlation makes panel-formation rule the dominant lever on recovery, with representativeness protective specifically when the panel balances the axis the confound rides on; caveat: synthetic, marginal-preserving simulation against a known oracle, and the protection is axis-conditional as the expertise-tier negative control demonstrates.](../figures/bloc_phase_diagram.png){#fig:blocphase width=95%}

Representativeness is not only a four-way contrast but a **continuous dial**. Fixing
the coupling at $\rho=0.90$ and forming panels with a tunable single-bloc
concentration $c$ — from balanced ($c=0$, Herfindahl index $1/B$) to single-bloc
($c=1$, Herfindahl index $1$) — recovery error climbs monotonically from
0.175 to 0.263 across the 6
dial levels (fraction of steps that increase error: 1.000;
[@fig:dial]). This is the closed-form Herfindahl account of §Methods made visible:
the panel's concentration index over the confound axis, a closed-form combinatorial statistic,
sets its shared-confound exposure and hence its no-answer-key recovery error.

Recovery error rises monotonically with concentration, while the realized correlation rises and then saturates once the scored trio becomes single-bloc. Claim: recovery error is a graded function of panel concentration over the confound axis, tracing the closed-form Herfindahl prediction rather than a binary representative-vs-single-bloc split; caveat: synthetic, marginal-accuracy-preserving simulation at one coupling level against a known oracle, and the protection implied by low concentration is axis-conditional — it holds only for the axis the confound rides on, as the expertise-tier negative control in [@fig:blocphase] shows.](../figures/bloc_concentration_dial.png){#fig:dial width=70%}

### Power budgets distinguish ranking from resolved contrasts

Before any "beats" wording, competence-first selection and representative sortition
are compared by separately bootstrapped mean intervals at the trio
(`strategy_separation`, `src/ntqr_allotment/statistics_analysis.py`): mean recovery
error 0.037 (competence-first) versus 0.122
(representative), a signed difference of -0.086 with a
CI-overlap verdict of **separated** — that is, the two
strategies' separately bootstrapped mean intervals do not overlap, so the
difference is not an artifact of within-strategy spread. The power study then
separates resolved contrasts from design-limited nulls: of
28 pairwise strategy contrasts,
12 are well-powered and
16 are underpowered at the current observation count, while
13 of 28 reach raw permutation-test
significance (12 after Holm-Bonferroni across the
28-test family). The strategy *ranking* is therefore a point
estimate ordering plus a set of explicitly tested contrasts, not a blanket claim
that every neighboring rank is a significant win. [@fig:powervn] shows the analytic
power-vs-sample-size curves that set these budgets. For a two-sample contrast, the
design quantities are standardized effect $d$, per-group observation count $n$
(seeded trials across the active profile cells), Type-I error $\alpha$,
target power $1-\beta$, and the minimum detectable effect (MDE) at the chosen $n$. The
budget is reported with a minimum detectable effect of 0.101 and between
5 and 543625 per-group observations
required to reach 80% power **for effects of the magnitudes observed in these
contrasts** — a prospective design target keyed to the observed effect sizes,
never retrospective observed power ([@fig:diagnosis],
`output/data/power_analysis.csv`).

![Design-adequacy diagnosis for every pairwise strategy contrast, from source `output/data/power_analysis.csv`: each row plots the observed standardized effect size (Cohen's $d$) against the minimum detectable effect (MDE) at 80% power, annotated with the permutation p-value and the per-group observation budgets needed to resolve an effect of that size. A contrast whose observed $|d|$ sits below its MDE marker is design-limited: the study could not have detected it even if it were real, so its non-significance is a statement about sample size, not about the absence of an effect. Claim: 16 of 28 contrasts are design-limited at the current observation count, which is why several neighboring-rank comparisons remain inconclusive; caveat: the budgets are keyed to the observed effect magnitudes and are prospective design targets, not retrospective observed power evidence.](../figures/power_design_diagnosis.png){#fig:diagnosis width=80%}

![Analytic two-sample power $1-\beta$ (y-axis) versus samples-per-group $n$ (x-axis, log scale), shown as a family of curves with one curve per representative Cohen's $d$ value, computed from source `output/data/power_analysis.csv` / `src/ntqr_allotment/power_analysis.py`; the horizontal dashed line marks the 80% power target at the chosen $\alpha$, and where each curve crosses it gives the $n$ that effect size requires. Read it as a budgeting tool: the smaller the standardized effect, the further right its curve crosses the dashed line, i.e. the more per-group observations are needed. Claim: small standardized effects require many more seeds per group than the current design provides, which is the mechanism behind the design-limited nulls; caveat: this is a prospective design-budget curve and an MDE visual, not retrospective observed power.](../figures/power_vs_n.png){#fig:powervn width=72%}

The remaining "inconclusive" verdicts are therefore statements about *design size*,
made explicit through the minimum detectable effect — not evidence of no effect, and
never reported as retrospective observed power.

### Companion diagnostics bound cost, correlation, fairness, and consistency

The companion alarm's answer-key enumeration is roughly cubic in corpus size
([@fig:alarm]): about 0.7 s at $Q=20$,
8.9 s at $Q=50$, and 97.9 s at $Q=100$ (measured by
`scripts/bench_alarm.py`, written to `output/data/alarm_timings.csv`). This is a real
ceiling on the alarm track, so it is opt-in and capped at $Q\leq30$. We report
it as a finding: the alarm is usable as a small-corpus consistency check, not as a
sweep-scale primitive.

![Measured alarm wall-clock time (seconds) versus corpus size $Q$ on log-log axes, from source `output/data/alarm_timings.csv`, with a cubic $O(Q^3)$ reference line overlaid. On log-log axes a power law is a straight line whose slope is its exponent, so the measured points tracking the reference slope is the visual evidence that the answer-key-enumeration alarm scales cubically in $Q$. The practical consequence is a hard ceiling: the wall-clock cost rises steeply enough that the alarm is usable only as a small-corpus consistency check. Claim: at the current implementation the alarm is small-corpus only and is therefore opt-in and capped; caveat: the absolute wall-clock constants are machine-local and load-dependent, so it is the cubic scaling, not the individual timings, that is the robust finding.](../figures/alarm_cost_curve.png){#fig:alarm width=70%}

Three further companion tracks measure structural properties of the pipeline rather than
recovery error, and we report them as diagnostics. The error-correlation track
records the mean realized correlation each formation strategy induces
([@fig:strategycorr]): single-bloc selection sits highest, consistent with its
status as the deliberately correlated comparator. The maximin fairness track
characterizes the representative lottery's selection-probability distribution over
the population ([@fig:fairness]) — the maximin objective is the floor on who can be
seated, independent of any downstream recovery number. The N-judge alarm-power track
records a saturated small-$Q$ alarm-firing rate across the plotted panel sizes
([@fig:alarmpower]). The ternary ($R=3$) track is consistency/feasibility only — it
confirms three-way vote profiles satisfy the NTQR axioms and is never an $R=3$ recovery
claim (out of scope) — so it yields a pass/fail check rather than a plotted number.

![Bar chart of the mean realized pairwise error correlation that each panel-formation strategy induces among its judges, measured by NTQR's own supervised estimator over the tolerance sweep, from source `output/data/independence_sweep.csv`. Higher bars mean the strategy seats judges whose mistakes are more correlated, which is precisely the error-independence assumption the exact trio solver leans on. Single-bloc selection is the tallest bar, consistent with its design as the deliberately correlated comparator, while representative and random draws sit lower. Read this as a structural property of the draw itself, upstream of any recovery number. Caveat: this is a structural diagnostic of the formed panel, not a recovery-effect claim about downstream EIE error.](../figures/strategy_correlation.png){#fig:strategycorr width=70%}

![Per-candidate selection probabilities under the representative maximin sortition lottery, computed from `src/ntqr_allotment/fairness.py` over the feasible panel draws. Each bar is one expert's probability of being seated across the lottery; the maximin objective explicitly maximises the smallest of these probabilities, so the figure should be read by its floor (the shortest bar) rather than its average — a fairer lottery lifts the worst-off candidate's chance of selection. This characterises the representation properties of the draw and is fully independent of any downstream evaluation number. Caveat: this describes panel-formation fairness only, not NTQR recovery error.](../figures/fairness_maximin.png){#fig:fairness width=70%}

![N-judge alarm firing rate as a function of panel size at small corpus size $Q$, computed live from `src/ntqr_allotment/ensemble.py`. The alarm fires when no single answer key can make all seated judges simultaneously axiom-consistent at the stated safety specification; the curve shows how often that happens as the panel grows. At the tight safety setting plotted here the rate is already saturated across the panel sizes shown, so the figure demonstrates that the N-judge alarm is executable and panel-size-indexed rather than establishing a monotone growth law (a looser setting would be needed to see a rising curve). Caveat: the alarm track is a consistency signal only, never a recovery method, and is bounded by the same $O(Q^3)$ answer-key enumeration, which confines it to small $Q$.](../figures/alarm_power.png){#fig:alarmpower width=70%}

## Real-Ollama postdoctoral panel results: live H5 companion

The live-Ollama results are separate empirical companion artifacts. They use one
local `gemma3:4b` model prompted as synthetic postdoctoral reviewers over
fictitious applications with synthetic age metadata. The result is not a
model-family comparison, not a human-review validation, and not evidence that age
belongs in real admissions or hiring review.

### Gemma ranking asks the same sampling question under prompt labels

The live artifact uses 12 seeds, 48
reviewers, 72 applications per seed, panel sizes
3, 6, and live Ollama provenance
(`gemma3:4b` digest a2af6cc3eb7f, config hash
5161ffe474b3, vote-cache entries 23688).
The best live postdoc EIE point estimate is same-bias selection at
0.216; the worst is expertise threshold at
0.347. For the three-seat panels, representative sortition has
EIE 0.225, same-bias selection has
0.228, expertise-threshold selection has
0.347, and random selection has 0.262.

![Side-by-side strategy ranking for the analytical vote model (square markers) and the live Gemma reviewer panel (circle markers), one row per sampling strategy, from source `output/data/postdoc_panel_results.json`. Metric: oracle-referenced EIE error (lower is better), aggregated by track, sampling strategy, and panel size, with descriptive intervals over 12 seeds. The two marker shapes are juxtaposed, never pooled, so the reader can see where the live model echoes the analytical ordering and where it departs; the horizontal gap between a strategy's square and circle is exactly that analytical-vs-live divergence. Claim: the live single-model panel is analysed as a within-model sampling-strategy stress test, not as an LLM-family comparison; caveat: it uses synthetic applications and age metadata only, one local Gemma model, and carries no human-review validation.](../figures/postdoc_strategy_ranking.png){#fig:postdocrank width=80%}

### Same-bias panels expose age-conditioned recommendations

The age-bias outcome is older-minus-younger recommendation rate. Positive values
mean older synthetic applicants are recommended more often; negative values mean
younger synthetic applicants are recommended more often. At the three-seat panel
grain, representative sortition's live disparity is
-0.190, while same-bias selection's live disparity
is -0.214. Age bias here *is* simply illegitimate:
because true quality is generated independently of age, any age-conditioned shift
is a reviewer acting on an irrelevant attribute. That is exactly why age is a
useful *probe* — it gives a clean, known-illegitimate signal whose magnitude we
can read directly — so the question is not whether age bias is acceptable (it is
not) but whether the upstream sampling rule **amplifies or contains** an
illegitimate bias the reviewers already carry. The disparities here are negative
across the board, meaning this model favors younger synthetic applicants; the
experiment measures that illegitimate behavior to compare bias containment across
sampling rules (age is a probe; see Ethics).

![Heatmap of the older-minus-younger recommendation-rate disparity expressed by the live Gemma reviewer panel, by sampling strategy (rows) and panel size (columns), from source `output/data/postdoc_panel_results.json`. Because true latent quality is generated independently of age, any non-zero cell is reviewer age-bias expression rather than signal: positive values mean older synthetic applicants are recommended more often, negative values mean younger applicants are. Metric: age-conditioned recommendation-rate difference, aggregated over 12 seeds; read down a column to compare how each sampling rule amplifies or dampens the irrelevant age signal. Claim: same-bias (single-bloc) sampling is the explicit bias-amplification stress test among the strategies; caveat: all applicants and ages are synthetic, and this figure does not validate Gemma or endorse age-aware real review.](../figures/postdoc_age_bias_heatmap.png){#fig:postdocbias width=72%}

### Analytical and Gemma cells stay juxtaposed, not pooled

The alignment artifact compares analytical prediction signs with live Gemma
observations by strategy and panel size. 8 of
8 cells are resolved after zero-sign cells are marked
unresolved; the resolved-cell sign-agreement rate is 0.500.
This agreement is a **weak directional check, not an independent match**: every
live Gemma age-disparity sign in this run is negative (the model uniformly
favors younger synthetic applicants), so the rate mostly measures how often the
analytical sign is also negative rather than a cell-by-cell coincidence of two
freely varying signals. This is the intended bridge between the synthetic and
live tracks: same causal question, shared sampling vocabulary, separate evidence
levels.

![Cell-by-cell alignment grid comparing the analytical age-disparity direction with the live Gemma direction, one cell per strategy x panel-size combination, from source `output/data/postdoc_panel_alignment.json`. Each cell is marked agree, disagree, or unresolved (a zero-sign cell on either track), so the figure functions as the explicit bridge between the controlled and the live track while keeping their uncertainties separate. Statistic: sign agreement between the analytical and live age-disparity directions; resolved-cell agreement 0.500 over 8 resolved cells. Because every live disparity sign is negative in this run, the agreement rate is a weak directional check rather than an independent match, and should be read as such. Claim: the analytical and empirical tracks can be compared cell by cell without pooling their uncertainty; caveat: single-model live evidence is descriptive and n-limited.](../figures/postdoc_empirical_alignment.png){#fig:postdocalign width=72%}

### Synthetic strategy ranking does not transfer to the live track

**H5 (does the synthetic ranking transfer to a live single-model panel?).** The
synthetic and live tracks are never pooled, and a matched-grain comparison shows
why pooling would mislead. At the shared three-seat panel grain
([@fig:trackinversion]) the strategy *rank order* inverts between tracks. The
rule with by far the lowest synthetic recovery error — expertise threshold at
0.037 — is the **worst** under the live Gemma panel
at 0.347. The other three strategies are bunched on *both*
tracks — synthetically at
0.118–0.124 and live at
0.225–0.262 — so they neither clearly
invert nor clearly transfer. The robust component of the non-transfer is therefore
the expertise-threshold flip alone — it is the lone clear outlier on both tracks
(best synthetic, worst live) — so the non-transfer claim rests on the
competence-first rule reversing, not on a precisely resolved ordering of the other
three (which are statistically indistinguishable on each track). We compare ranks, not magnitudes, because
the two tracks own different oracles and different uncertainty, so the figure is
a qualitative non-transfer result rather than a pooled effect size.

![Cross-track strategy-ranking inversion at the matched three-seat grain, shown as a slope chart, from source `output/data/sweep_aggregated.csv` (synthetic `POWER_*_SIZE3`, left column) and source `output/data/postdoc_panel_results.json` (live `POSTDOC_*_EIE`, right column). Each strategy is a coloured line connecting its rank under the synthetic track to its rank under the live track; lines that cross are strategies whose standing reverses, and the steepest crossers are expertise threshold (synthetic best to live worst) and single-bloc selection (synthetic worst to live rank-two), while representative sortition is near-best on both tracks. The y-axis is ordinal rank, with the raw error annotated at each node so the reader can see that the live top three are tightly bunched while expertise threshold is the lone outlier. Statistic: ordinal EIE-error rank per track over 96 synthetic seeds and 12 live seeds; ranks compared, magnitudes not pooled (the two tracks own different oracles and uncertainty). Claim: the formation rule that is best blind on synthetic data is worst under one local Gemma model, so the synthetic ranking does not transfer to the live single-model panel; caveat: single-model live evidence is descriptive and n-limited, not a human-review validation.](../figures/track_ranking_inversion.png){#fig:trackinversion width=80%}

**Why the ranking inverts.** The two tracks do genuinely disagree, and for a
principled reason. In the synthetic track the generator *sets* each judge's
accuracy directly, so competence-first selection seats genuinely higher-accuracy
judges and the exact solver recovers them cleanly — the ordering is, in part,
built into the data-generating process. Live, "expertise" is only a *prompt
instruction*: the local `gemma3:4b` model need not behave more accurately,
or with more independent errors, when it is told it is an expert reviewer.
Selecting personas by their stated expertise therefore seats no better live
judges, and the rule that wins by construction on synthetic data carries no
guaranteed live advantage — here it is the worst. Put differently, the synthetic
oracle rewards a property (controlled judge accuracy) that the prompted model does
not inherit from the persona label. This is a hypothesis about the mechanism, not
a measured causal claim, and it is the empirical reason the manuscript keeps the
synthetic and live tracks at distinct inference levels rather than reporting a
single cross-track strategy winner.

# Discussion: claim boundaries and implications

## Hypothesis verdicts before interpretation

We return an explicit verdict on each pre-stated hypothesis (Introduction, H1–H5)
before interpreting it, so the contribution is the adjudication itself rather than
a single narrative.

- **H1 (formation strategy is the dominant lever) — supported.** The four panels
  do not separate into a graded four-way ladder. Competence-first selection
  (**expertise threshold**) is clearly best at
  0.037, while representative sortition, single-bloc
  selection, and random selection cluster around
  0.147-0.148 with
  overlapping intervals. The resolved result is competence-first versus the
  bottom cluster, not a precise ordering inside that cluster.
- **H2 (concentrating correlated error degrades recovery) — unresolved on the
  baseline grid, then RESOLVED by the composition-coupled confound.** On the
  baseline generator the representative-vs-single-bloc contrast is design-limited,
  for a structural reason: that generator never realizes H2's premise, because its
  judges err independently and ideology shifts only marginal accuracy, so the
  strategies coincide *by construction* and no regime sweep can fan them out. Once a
  composition-coupled, marginal-accuracy-preserving error confound supplies the
  missing channel ([@fig:blocphase]), the contrast resolves cleanly: single-bloc
  error exceeds representative error in 180/205 matched regimes (paired
  mean 0.102, 95% CI ±0.012), the gap widening from
  0.000 to 0.112 as coupling rises. The advantage is real but
  **conditional**: an orthogonal-axis negative control removes it, so we claim
  "balancing the axis the confound rides on preserves recovery," not a universal
  sortition law.
- **H3 (size is a sampling knob, not guaranteed improvement) — supported only in
  the bounded sense.** A paired, regime-controlled test resolves a trio-to-six-seat
  size effect for 3 of the four strategies, and every
  resolved effect is a tiny increase in error: random selection
  (+0.015), representative sortition
  (+0.007), and competence-first selection
  (+0.004). Single-bloc is within noise. So more
  experts do not help here, but they also do not create a material penalty; size is
  essentially neutral at this grid, and the dominant lever is strategy, not size.
- **H4 (error-correlation is measurable, and recovery degrades with it) —
  diagnostic confirmed; recovery slope resolved by the composition-coupled
  instrument.** The diagnostic works — the realized correlation tracks the injected
  coupling (0.019 to 0.123). The *global-injection*
  tolerance sweep leaves the recovery-vs-correlation slope unresolved
  (-0.145, 95% CI [-4.335, 0.911] crosses zero), and we now
  read that as a limitation of that instrument — it couples correlation uniformly
  to a fixed trio and uses a small grid — rather than as evidence of no effect. The
  composition-coupled, marginal-accuracy-preserving sweep ([@fig:blocphase]), with
  far more observations per point, resolves the recovery half in the affirmative:
  recovery error rises with within-bloc coupling for the panels that
  concentrate the confound, and the closed-form Herfindahl account
  (§Methods) explains the ordering. So the recovery half is a result, not an open
  question, under a correctly specified confound.
- **H5 (the synthetic ranking transfers to a live single-model panel) —
  rejected.** At the matched three-seat grain the ranking inverts: the rule that is
  best blind on synthetic data (expertise threshold,
  0.037) is the worst under the live
  `gemma3:4b` panel (0.347). The robust component is that
  expertise-threshold flip; the live top three are bunched and the evidence is
  single-model and n-limited, so we report non-transfer of the best-synthetic rule
  rather than a precise live winner. The suggested caution, scoped to this one
  companion model: "choose the most expert judges" most cleanly minimized
  blind-recovery error on judges of *known* accuracy, yet it was the worst rule once
  "expert" was merely a prompt label the model need not honor — a hypothesis that
  self-asserted expertise may be an unsafe blind-evaluation selection criterion,
  worth testing beyond one model rather than an established result.

The remaining subsections elaborate the mechanism behind each verdict.

## Practical lesson: selection rule before panel size

Three usable lessons follow for anyone selecting judges to be evaluated without an
answer key. (i) *Which* rule forms the panel matters far more than how many judges
it seats: competence-first selection set the lowest blind-recovery error here, while
panel size was essentially neutral (H1, H3). (ii) Representative selection protects
unsupervised recovery *only* when the lottery balances the very attribute a shared
error rides on; balanced on the wrong axis it gives no protection (H2/H4, negative
control), and the exposure it controls is a closed-form concentration (Herfindahl)
index you can compute on a *proposed* panel before any votes are cast. (iii) The
advantage of picking "expert" judges did not survive when judges were a prompted
live model rather than parameterized synthetic ones (H5), so a selection rule
validated on controllable judges cannot be assumed to carry over to real ones.

## Formation strategy is the measured lever

Studying NTQR *upstream* — at the panel-formation step rather than at the estimator
— reframes ground-truth-free evaluation as a selection problem. The strongest
finding is that competence-first selection sets a much lower downstream
no-answer-key error floor than the other panel-formation rules. The other three
strategies cluster tightly enough that their point-estimate order should not be
read as a substantive ranking. The scientific claim is therefore about the
competence-first-vs-rest separation, not about naming a bottom-cluster winner or
loser.

That framing matters for application review because peer-review scholarship
already treats expert judgment as socially situated and panel-dependent rather
than mechanically objective [Lamont (2009)](https://doi.org/10.4159/9780674054158);
[Lee et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22784), and because empirical
studies find substantial reviewer disagreement on the same submitted work
[Cole et al. (1981)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.7302566);
[Pier et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1714379115), score-model
uncertainty large enough to alter the implied funded set
[Johnson (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0804538105), and limited
grant-productivity predictiveness of NIH percentiles
[Fang et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13323). The manuscript's
increment is narrower: it instruments one selection mechanism and asks whether
different panel draws change an unlabeled evaluator's oracle-referenced error.
The claim is about generated artifacts and one local Gemma stress test, not about
the global reliability of academic review.

This is, in part, a result *against* the intuitive case for sortition. A
representative lottery is the fair, auditable way to form a panel, but on this
instrument it does not minimize oracle-referenced EIE error — competence-first does. We
report that plainly rather than engineering a narrative in which sortition wins.
That is not a general refutation of sortition, deliberative participation, or the
"diversity can beat ability" result. Those arguments rely on different objectives
and premises: democratic legitimacy and public consultation
[Fishkin (2009)](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/when-the-people-speak-9780199604432),
search diversity [Hong and Page (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0403723101),
and jury-theorem aggregation under competence and conditional-independence
assumptions [Grofman et al. (1983)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00125672).
The present result is narrower: in this binary noisy-judge instrument,
competence-first sampling gives the lowest oracle-referenced EIE error.
Relative to the single-bloc comparator the representative draw's point estimate is
now reported over the full active regime grid rather than collapsed to two
panel-size means. Some cells resolve in the predicted direction, others remain
descriptive or design-limited, so we claim artifact-bounded regime structure, not a
general sortition advantage over single-bloc selection.

## Design-limited nulls remain results

Two results are bounded rather than universal, and we do not dress them up.

1. **On the baseline grid, representative vs ideological is design-limited.** Varying
   expert stringency, bias spread, and panel size jointly, the heatmap reports which
   regenerated synthetic cells align with the directional prediction, which resolve by
   descriptive intervals, and which remain uncertain — but the pooled contrast is not
   resolved there, *by construction*, because the baseline judges err independently.
   It resolves only once the composition-coupled confound supplies the correlation
   channel (see the H2 verdict and [@fig:blocphase]); the null is a property of the
   baseline design, not of sortition.

2. **Size is not a uniform power knob.** A paired, regime-controlled contrast
   resolves a trio-to-six-seat size change for 3 of the
   four strategies, and each resolved change is a small increase in error. The
   largest delta is +0.015, so more experts do not
   help and at most very slightly hurt. The clean "more experts always helps" story
   is rejected, but the result is essentially neutral rather than a material size
   penalty. That is consistent with peer-review
   jury-theorem work: adding reviewers helps only under assumptions about
   competence, dependence, and aggregation that must be checked rather than
   presumed [Arvan et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1086/719117).

Reporting these nulls is the point of building a measurement instrument rather than
a demonstration.

## Independence explains why strategy ordering changes

NTQR's EIE solver rests on the judges' errors being approximately independent. On
the baseline generator, single-bloc selection is indistinguishable from
representative and random selection **by construction**: ideology there shifts only
each judge's marginal accuracy, every judge errs from an independent stream, and an
agreement-only estimator cannot be moved by composition. Single-bloc becomes the
*separable* adversarial comparator only once the composition-coupled confound
supplies a genuine cross-judge error-correlation channel ([@fig:blocphase]).
Competence-first panels pair high accuracy with whatever independence the population
affords, giving the solver the easiest system to invert. The fair-lottery argument
should therefore be made from auditability, representation, and bounded empirical
performance rather than from an unqualified error-minimization win.

## Error independence must be measured before interpretation

The assumption the whole ordering hangs on — that judges' errors are approximately
independent — is, in this instrument, no longer an assumption but a measured
quantity. The controlled-correlation sweep confirms the *knob works*: the realized
pairwise correlation NTQR reports rises with the injected coupling
(0.019 to 0.123). What it does **not** yet resolve, at
this grid, is whether that correlation degrades recovery — the fitted slope is
**statistically indistinguishable from zero** (-0.145, 95% CI
[-4.335, 0.911] spans zero), unresolved rather than absent — and the power
layer explains why that is unsurprising rather than disappointing:
12 of 28 contrasts are well-powered
at the current seed count (MDE 0.101), 13 reach
nominal significance, and 12 survive Holm correction.
The honest reading is that the current design resolves the largest separations but
leaves smaller neighboring contrasts design-limited. The strategy *ranking* remains
an ordering of point estimates; the analysis says exactly how many seeds would let
the unresolved contrasts resolve. That global-injection slope is, in any case, the
wrong instrument for the recovery question — it couples correlation to a fixed trio
regardless of how the panel was formed; the marginal-preserving composition-coupled
sweep ([@fig:blocphase]) resolves the recovery half in the affirmative, as
adjudicated in the H4 verdict above.

The Gemma postdoctoral panel is the direct live look at the same sampling mechanism
under a real local LLM. It does not ask whether one model family beats another; it
asks whether representative, random, same-bias, and expertise-first sampling leave
different traces when one `gemma3:4b` model is prompted as reviewers with
different expertise and irrelevant age-bias profiles. The live artifact reports
72 fictitious applications per seed and model provenance
(digest a2af6cc3eb7f), while the alignment artifact juxtaposes
analytical signs with Gemma signs over 8 strategy-size
cells. We still deliberately under-claim it: the applications and ages are
synthetic, the reviewer personas are prompts rather than humans, and the resolved
agreement rate (0.500 over
8 resolved cells) is descriptive companion
evidence, not validation that Gemma or any age-aware real review process is
appropriate. The competence-first versus representative comparison is likewise
gated by an explicit CI-overlap verdict (**separated**, means
0.037 vs 0.122), so "beats" is never asserted across
overlapping intervals.

## Scholarship frames the stress test, not the evidence level

The postdoctoral-review setting is intentionally close to a literature where
selection, status, and bias are known concerns. Cumulative-advantage accounts of
scientific recognition [Merton (1968)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.159.3810.56),
resubmission experiments showing fragility in journal review
[Peters and Ceci (1982)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00011183), blind-review
experiments and observational bias studies
[Tomkins et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1707323114);
[Helmer et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21718), and empirical
studies of fellowship or grant outcomes
[Wennerås and Wold (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1038/387341a0);
[Ginther et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1196783) make it
reasonable to study reviewer sampling, not only evaluator algebra. The age axis
has the same status: ageism and age-discrimination findings motivate it as a
protected-attribute stress test
[North and Fiske (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167213480043);
[Neumark et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1086/701029), but the manuscript does
not infer anything about real postdoctoral age discrimination from prompted Gemma
votes.

The synthetic and Gemma tracks therefore answer different questions. The
synthetic track can make controlled claims because it owns the oracle label and
the expert parameters. The live Gemma track can only show whether the same
sampling vocabulary produces measurable traces under one local model with
serialized provenance. Prompted LLM evaluation is itself an active measurement
problem, not a neutral readout [Zheng et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685),
and language-model risk scholarship cautions against treating model text as a
transparent substitute for human judgment
[Bender et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922), so the correct
inference level is empirical feasibility plus directional stress testing.
Lottery and collective-allocation proposals in science funding
[Bollen et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1002/embr.201338068);
[Fang and Casadevall (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00422-16), and
maverick-science arguments for lotteries
[Avin (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2018.11.006) make randomized
institutional design a legitimate comparator, but they do not license a claim
that lottery-formed reviewer panels optimize NTQR recovery. Scholarship supplies
the problem context and the variables worth stress-testing; regenerated artifacts
supply the evidence.

The pre-1800 sources sharpen that boundary rather than broadening the claim.
Aristotle, Aquinas, Contarini, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Borda, and Condorcet show
that lot, choice, mixed selection, and probabilistic group judgment have long been
treated as procedural responses to faction, legitimacy, and uncertainty. They do
not license a claim that historical sortition "validates" this synthetic NTQR
instrument. The contribution here is narrower: a regenerated experiment that
keeps historical and modern motivations upstream of the evidentiary claim, then
tests how panel formation changes oracle-referenced blind recovery.

The historical sources also draw a useful negative boundary. We exclude gambling
lotteries, divinatory lots, and broad political-theory claims that are not about
selecting evaluators or aggregating judgments. The manuscript's analogy is
procedural: randomness can distribute evaluative authority when deterministic
selection is capture-prone or status-weighted. Whether that helps an unlabeled
evaluator is not answered by the history; it is answered by the regenerated
artifacts above.

## Limitations: synthetic scope, single-model live evidence, historical analogy

The reported `manuscript_contrast` grid fixes prevalence and corpus size while varying
mean expertise, bias, panel size, and strategy; it uses
96 experts, 300 as the modal item count in the rendered tokens,
and up to 8 trios per panel over 96 seeds. The repository now
defines broader sensitivity and finer panel-ladder profiles, but those profiles are
configuration surfaces until regenerated and audited as manuscript evidence; the
reported results remain bounded to the active profile. The
oracle-closest tie-break is deliberately charitable to the unsupervised estimate, so
reported errors are a lower bound on what a blind tie-break would incur. The alarm's
$O(Q^3)$ cost confines the consistency-alarm track to small corpora
($Q\leq30$), so the alarm cannot yet serve as a sweep-scale signal. The
statistical-power analysis shows most strategy contrasts are underpowered at the
current seed count, so several headline comparisons are design-limited rather than
settled. The Gemma postdoctoral panel is also bounded: it uses fictitious
applications, synthetic age metadata, prompted reviewer personas, and one local
model. It tests whether the sampling mechanism is visible under that empirical
stress test; it does not establish human-review performance or a policy claim about
age. Finally, the synthetic generator is a model of noisy judges, not a guarantee
about real ones.

## Synthetic and live tracks operate at different inference levels

This manuscript follows a standard division between controlled experiment and
empirical companion evidence. The deterministic synthetic track is the controlled
Results spine: it generates the strategy-ranking, panel-size, controlled-correlation,
power-budget, alarm-cost, and analytical-alignment numbers from regenerated local
artifacts. Those claims are validated against known oracle labels because the
generator owns the truth labels.

The real-Ollama track is reported as separate live artifacts and empirical companion evidence, not a pooled extension of the synthetic sweep.
It was performed locally with required-live `gemma3:4b` (full provenance in Methods), showing the same sampling vocabulary run on a real local model prompted as different reviewers.
It does not validate the full synthetic regime grid, establish a population effect size, or prove that Gemma substitutes for human reviewers.

The combined interpretation is therefore deliberately tiered: synthetic experiments
support the controlled mechanism and regime maps; analytical checks test directional
expectations against those regenerated artifacts; and live Ollama runs demonstrate
empirical feasibility plus n-limited directional support. Wider parameter sweeps and
larger empirical panels are the next steps before any stronger general claim.

## Data, code, and generated-artifact availability

All source code, methods, and documentation are openly available at the public
repository [`docxology/ntqr_allotment`](https://github.com/docxology/ntqr_allotment):
the deterministic synthetic instrument, the bloc-confound and Herfindahl modules,
the live Gemma vote cache with serialized model provenance, every figure, and the
manuscript regeneration pipeline. Every reported number is
token-injected from `output/data/` by
`src/ntqr_allotment/manuscript_variables.py`, so no result is hand-transcribed and
the manuscript regenerates from source under a zero-orphan token contract. The
synthetic track is fully deterministic under fixed seeds (profile config hash
`fda4da941cf0`); the live track reproduces against a local Ollama
`gemma3:4b` instance (digest `a2af6cc3eb7f`, config hash
`5161ffe474b3`) using the serialized, resumable per-vote cache keyed on
the config hash, seed, reviewer, application, model digest, and decode parameters.
A steganographic provenance variant of the PDF additionally carries an extractable
hash of the current source PDF, verified by `scripts/verify_stego.py`. The archival
DOI is [10.5281/zenodo.21083779](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21083779).

## Ethics, protected attributes, and competing interests

The postdoctoral-review setting is entirely synthetic: the applications, latent
quality labels, reviewer personas, and age metadata are all generated, and no human
subjects, real applicants, or real review records are involved. True latent quality
is generated independently of age; age enters only as a protected-attribute stress
test for bias expression under sampling, and its use here is diagnostic, not an
endorsement of using age in real admissions, hiring, or fellowship review. The live
language-model outputs are treated as an instrumented measurement of a prompted
system, not as a substitute for human judgment. The authors declare no competing
interests.
