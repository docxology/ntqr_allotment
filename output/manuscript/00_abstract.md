# Abstract

How should you choose the judges, jurors, or reviewers who form a panel — and does
that upstream choice change how well you can evaluate them *without an answer key*?
A panel can be selected many ways — by competence, by a representative lottery
(**sortition**), by ideological bloc, or at random — and, separately, its noisy
judgments can be evaluated blind: given the agreement/disagreement pattern among
three binary judges, the `ntqr` package's error-independent (EIE) evaluator returns
logically consistent estimates of item prevalence and per-judge accuracy with no
labels at all. But that evaluator takes the panel as given. We join the two
questions and ask whether the *rule that forms the panel* changes the
oracle-referenced error of the no-answer-key evaluation — how far the blind estimate
lands from the answer-key result, lower being better.

On a fully deterministic instrument (96 seeds, 96 experts,
300 items), the dominant lever is *which* rule forms the panel, not its size:
competence-first selection recovers best (0.037), while
representative, single-bloc, and random selection collapse together — *by
construction*, because with independent judge errors composition cannot move an
estimator that only sees agreement. Supplying the missing channel — same-group judges
sharing a latent, marginal-accuracy-preserving error confound — makes the strategies
fan out monotonically as within-bloc coupling rises: representative sortition stays
flat while single-bloc selection degrades, the gap widening from 0.000 to
0.112. Within this instrument the relationship is closed-form: recovery
error tracks the panel's **Herfindahl concentration index** over the axis a shared
error rides on — minimized exactly by a balanced (representative) draw, maximized by a
single bloc — and a continuous representativeness dial confirms error rises
monotonically with it.

The protection is **conditional**: re-keying the confound to an axis the lottery does
not balance erases the protection (0.147→0.229). The
lesson for selecting and evaluating panels is thus a falsifiable, simulation-bounded
prediction, not a preference for any one rule — representativeness protects blind
recovery precisely when the panel balances the attribute a shared error rides on.
Evidence is synthetic and oracle-scored; in a single small live model
(gemma3:4b) the synthetically-best competence-first rule was the worst,
illustrating that a selection rule validated on parameterized judges need not carry
over to prompted ones — a hypothesis to test, not an established caution. All methods
and documentation are openly available at the public repository
